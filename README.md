# wowAddonUpdater
Amateure stuff, but have fun!

note that you prob. should wipe your interface folder before pressing "OK"

also if you erase some line in the middle, you can get rid of it by saving and loading
and then press "Del Rows" because it will sort to bottom

add URL to zipfiles for addons

press "target path" and add your wow installation-interface/addons folder

TODO:

support other format than zipfiles
